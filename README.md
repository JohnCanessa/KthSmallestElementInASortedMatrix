LeetCode 378 Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix
https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/july-leetcoding-challenge-2021/608/week-1-july-1st-july-7th/3805/

This is problem 378.
For some reason if you look it up on the LeetCode web site the standard window
decribing problems is not displayed. I believe it is due to the fact that this
problem was selected for the first week of July 1st - July 7th.

This problem can be solved using a modified binary search approach.
If interested in my approach and comments I invite you to read the
following post in my blog:

Keep in mind that one of the best ways to learn is to read and experiment.
In addition, practice makes perfect.

Enjoy;
